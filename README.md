Three.js is essentially a wrapper for WebGL, which is a lower level language for creating 3D & 2D renderings in a canvas element. If you're interested in learning more about the lower level, Fireship has a nice tl;dr video [WebGL 3D Graphics Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-9LEoYYvE4)
